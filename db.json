      "content": "Getting the date in JavaScript isn't usually a problem, but formatting these dates to suit your project can be cumbersome for beginners. Because of this, most people eventually end up using libraries.  The most used method to get the date in JavaScript is the new Date() object.  By default, when you run new Date() in your terminal, it uses your browser's time zone and displays the date as a full text string, like Fri Jul 02 2021 12:44:45 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time).  But having something like this in your web page or application is not professional and isn't easy to read. So this forces you to look for better ways to format these dates.  Let’s take a look at some methods that operate on a date object.",

      "title": "How to Format Dates in JS",
      "content": "Getting the date in JavaScript isn't usually a problem, but formatting these dates to suit your project can be cumbersome for beginners. Because of this, most people eventually end up using libraries.  The most used method to get the date in JavaScript is the new Date() object.  By default, when you run new Date() in your terminal, it uses your browser's time zone and displays the date as a full text string, like Fri Jul 02 2021 12:44:45 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time).  But having something like this in your web page or application is not professional and isn't easy to read. So this forces you to look for better ways to format these dates.  Let’s take a look at some methods that operate on a date object.",

      "content": "There are so many methods that you can apply to the date object. You can use these methods to get information from a date object. Here are some of them:  getFullYear() – gets the year as a four digit number (yyyy) getMonth() – gets the month as a number (0-11) getDate() – gets the day as a number (1-31) getHours() – gets the hour (0-23) And lots more…  Unfortunately, most of these methods still needs a lot of code to convert the dates to the format we desire.  For example, new Date().getMonth() will output 6 which stands for July.",
